                If you procrastinate for any reason, you will find
                it difficult to get everything done when you need to.
                You may rush to make up the time you wasted getting started,
                resulting in careless work and errors.

                you during your study times. First, your work is interrupted.
                It is not that easy to get back to what you were doing.
                Second, your friends may talk about things that will distract
                you from what you need to do.
                Here's a simple idea - turn off your cell phone during your study times.
